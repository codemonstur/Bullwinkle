# Bullwinkle lib

A parser for [Backus-Naur Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus-Naur_form).
[Original code](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/Bullwinkle) written by [Sylvain Hall√©](http://leduotang.ca/sylvain).
The original readme can be found [here]().

My main reason for rewriting this library is to get it to parse [Java BNF](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/RegAut/JavaBNF.html).
This code doesn't do that (yet).
Currently it fails with a maximum recursion reached error.

This project represent the bulk of the code of the original project.
It can be used as a library in other tools.
